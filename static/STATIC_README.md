# Static Media

We are using `gulp` and `npm` for our static build process.

Do NOT edit anything in the `dist/` directory.

Local development uses media from `dist/` and we are firm believers in building
static assets and committing them to the repo before deployments. This way we
always are testing and exercise exactly what will be served in production. It
also makes our deployment simpler.
